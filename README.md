## Overview

### What's the problem?

There is a growing interest in enabling communities to cooperate among themselves to solve these problems, whether it be to advertise where supplies are held, offer assistance for collections, or other local services like volunteer deliveries.

In times of crisis, such as the 2020 SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19 or "Novel Coronavirus") crisis, while federal and local governments may be rolling out broad programs, cooperation at the local level is usually the most effective way of getting help to where it is most needed as quickly as possible. Traditional social media is one way of communicating within a community, but this is (by its very design) not locally focused, and often not sufficiently structured to enable rapid discovery of help needed.

In the COVID-19 crisis, we have already seen shortages of local food, medical equipment, and other supplies. In addition, the recommended (or required) self-isolation and social distancing measures can compound the problem by preventing people from easily getting to locations with the best stocks of supplies.

What is needed is a solution that empowers communities to easily connect and provide this information to each other.

### How can technology help?

Mobile, web, and cloud services enable rapid deployment of applications that can empower cooperation in the community. [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/) is a service on [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com) that allows you to build, train, and deploy conversational interactions into any application, device, or channel.

Creating a chatbot using Watson Assistant can help you address the issues that your users may face while trying to gather the necessary information. Embedding location/routing services (like [HERE](https://developer.here.com/products/routing)) can enhance such applications, giving optimum guidance so that they are outside of their isolation location for the minimum amount of time.

## The idea

The goal is to provide a mobile application, along with server-side components, that serves as the basis for developers to build out a community cooperation application that addresses local needs for food, equipment, and resources.
It would allow both "Suppliers" (such as a store or a community member who has produce they can sell or distribute) to make people aware of what the have; and consumers ("Recipients") to locate where these supplies are, and, if necessary, guide them to the appropriate locations to pick them up.

## How it works

A Supplier (who may be a regular resident, a small business, a voluntary organization, etc.) that has food, supplies, resources, or other essentials they can provide opens the mobile application and fills out a brief form that indicates what they have. This information is then stored in a database in the IBM Cloud.

A Recipient, who is in need of food, supplies, resources, or other essentials, opens the mobile application and can use the chat interface to locate supplies near them. For instance, they might type "Where can I find bread?" or "Can someone collect my shopping for me?" The mobile application then accesses the database (after first understanding the question via Watson Assistant) and then displays a map showing locally where they can find what they are looking for.

## Diagrams

![Cooperation architecture diagram](/images/architecture-diagram.png)

This solution starter idea combines a chat interface (Watson Assistant), data storage to hold the status of supplies available, and location services with real-time information to get users the information they need.

1. The Recipient launches the mobile app and can access information across multiple services.
1. The Recipient can ask questions to Watson Assistant and get answers on food/service availability questions.
1. The Supplier can post the availability of stock or services they can provide, as well as locate the items they need.
1. The Recipient can obtain geolocation data to plot routes to collect (or drop off) supplies using HERE Location Services.

### Steps

1. [Set up an instance of Watson Assistant](#1-set-up-an-instance-of-watson-assistant).
1. [Provision a CouchDB instance using Cloudant](#2-Provision-a-CouchDB-instance-using-Cloudant).
1. [Generate an API Key from the HERE Developer Portal](#3-generate-an-api-key-from-the-here-developer-portal).
1. [Run the server](#4-run-the-server).
1. [Run the mobile application](#5-run-the-mobile-application).

### 1. Set up an instance of Watson Assistant

Log in to IBM Cloud and provision a Watson Assistant instance.

1. Provision an instance of **Watson Assistant** from the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant).
1. Launch the Watson Assistant service.
1. [Create an **Assistant**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-add).
1. [Add a dialog skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-dialog-add) to the **Assistant** by importing the [`starter-kit-cooperation-dialog-skill.json`](./starter-kit/assistant/starter-kit-cooperation-dialog-skill.json) file.
1. Go back to All Assistants page, open **Settings** from the action menu ( **`⋮`** ) and click on **API Details**.
1. Note the **Assistant ID**, **API Key**, and **Assistant URL**. For **Assistant URL**, make note of the base URL/domain (e.g., `https://api.us-south.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com` or `https://api.eu-gb.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com`) and not the full directory/path. You will need all three of these values in Step 4 below.

1. Go to **Preview Link** to get a link to test and verify the dialog skill.

### 2: Provision a CouchDB instance using Cloudant

Log into the IBM Cloud and provision a [CouchDB instance using Cloudant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant).

1. From the catalog, select Databases and then the Cloudant panel.
1. Once selected, you can choose your Cloudant plan -- there is a free tier for simple testing that is sufficient to run this CIR example. You should choose an appropriate region, give the service a name, and it is recommended you choose **Use only IAM** under **Available authentication methods**. You can leave the other settings with their defaults. Click the blue **Create** button when ready.
1. Once your Cloudant instance has been created, you need to create a service credential that the CIR API Server can use to communicate with it. By selecting your running Cloudant instance, you can choose **Service credentials** from the left-hand menu. Create a new service credential and give it a name (it doesn't matter what you call it).
1. Once created, you can display the credentials by selecting **view service credentials**, and then copy the credential, so you are ready to paste it into the code of the API server in Step 4.

### 3. Generate an API Key from the HERE Developer Portal

The application uses HERE Location Services for maps, searching, and routing.

To access these services, you'll need an API key. Follow the instructions outlined in the [HERE Developer Portal](https://developer.here.com/ref/IBM_starterkit_Covid?create=Freemium-Basic) to [generate a JavaScript API key](https://developer.here.com/documentation/authentication/dev_guide/topics/api-key-credentials.html).

### 4. Run the server

To set up and launch the server application:

1. Go to the `starter-kit/server-app` directory of the cloned repo.
1. Copy the `.env.example` file in the `starter-kit/server-app` directory, and create a new file named `.env`.
1. Edit the newly created `.env` file and update the `ASSISTANT_URL`, `ASSISTANT_ID`, and `ASSISTANT_IAM_APIKEY` with the values from the dialog skill's API Detail page in Watson Assistant, from Step 1. Also, update the `CLOUDANT_ID` and `CLOUDANT_IAM_APIKEY` with the values from the service credential you created in Step 2. (Note that the `username` from the credential is what should be used for the `CLOUDANT_ID`.)
1. Edit the **name** value in the `manifest.yml` file to your application name (for example, _my-app-name_).
1. From a terminal:
    1. Go to the `starter-kit/server-app` directory of the cloned repo.
    1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
    1. Launch the server application locally or deploy to IBM Cloud:
        - To run locally:
            1. Start the application: `npm start`.
            1. The server can be accessed at <http://localhost:3000>.
        - To deploy to IBM Cloud:
            1. Log in to your IBM Cloud account using the IBM Cloud CLI: `ibmcloud login`.
            1. Target a Cloud Foundry org and space: `ibmcloud target --cf`.
            1. Push the app to IBM Cloud: `ibmcloud app push`.
            1. The server can be accessed at a URL using the **name** given in the `manifest.yml` file (for example,  <https://my-app-name.bluemix.net>).

### 5. Run the mobile application

To run the mobile application (using the Xcode iOS Simulator or Android Studio Emulator):

1. Go to the `starter-kit/mobile-app` directory of the cloned repo.
1. Copy the `.env.example` file in the `starter-kit/mobile-app` directory, and create a file named `.env`.
1. Edit the newly created `.env` file:
    - Update the `STARTER_KIT_SERVER_URL` with the URL to the server app launched in the previous step.
        > **Note**: If you are running the server locally and testing with the Android Emulator set the `STARTER_KIT_SERVER_URL` using the local machine's URL (e.g., `http://10.0.2.2:3000`) instead of `localhost`
    - Update the `HERE_APIKEY` with the API key generated in the HERE Developer Portal.
1. From a terminal:
    1. Go to the `starter-kit/mobile-app` directory.
    1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
    1. **iOS only**: Go to the `ios` directory: `cd ios`.
    1. **iOS only**: Install pod dependencies: `pod install`.
    1. **iOS only**: Return to the `mobile-app` directory: `cd ../`.
    1. Launch the app in the simulator/emulator:
        - **iOS only**: `npm run ios`
            > **Note**: You should be running at least iOS 13.0. The first time you launch the simulator, you should ensure that you set a Location in the Features menu.
        - **Android only**: `npm run android`
            > **Note**: Your Android Studio needs to have the `Android 9 (Pie)` SDK and a `Pie API Level 28` virtual device 
            - **Alternative way to run on Android**: `react-native run-android` 
            1. **Android only**: Open Android Studio and setup the project with the android folder. 
            1. **Android only**: Open Android Virtual Device Manager and launch the virtual device installed.
            1. **Android only**: Click on Debug in Android Studio.

With the application running in the simulator/emulator, you should be able to navigate through the various screens:
